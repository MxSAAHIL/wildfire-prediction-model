🔥 Forest Fire FWI Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI) using a Ridge Regression machine learning model. By entering environmental and fire-behaviour parameters, the system estimates wildfire intensity and helps in early fire-risk assessment.

📌 Project Overview

Wildfires are highly influenced by weather and fuel conditions. This project uses real forest-fire data and applies machine learning to predict the FWI, which indicates the potential spread and severity of forest fires.
The model is deployed using a simple Flask interface for easy user interaction.
